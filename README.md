# Java Learning and Practice Repository

I've started learning Java 1.5 months ago, so I'll start by uploading very simple and basic Java programs and will gradually move forward to more complex problems. This repository serves as a place for me to practice and improve my Java skills over time.

## Contents
- **Basic Programs:** Simple Java programs to get started with Java syntax and basic concepts.
- **Intermediate Programs:** Programs that cover more advanced topics and common programming challenges.
- **Advanced Programs:** Complex problems and projects to deepen understanding and mastery of Java.

## Contribution
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this repository. Whether you want to:
- Improve existing code.
- Suggest new ideas and improvements.
- Add new programs and solutions.

Please use the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/Pant-1603/JavaPractice-Collection/discussions) to share your suggestions and ideas. I'll be grateful to learn from such a vibrant community.

## Usage
Each Java file is self-contained. You can compile and run them individually. The programs are organized by difficulty and concept to help track progress.
